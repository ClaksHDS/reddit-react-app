# Reddit _Stay Curious_

> Front-end project of a **Reddit client application** for Codecademy's Front End Engineering Path.
> Reddit is a website where people share links to articles, media and other things on the web.

### Features

> The app will allow users to _browse popular subreddits_, _search posts_ and _see comments_ attached to each post. Users can see an initial view of the data when first visiting the app, they can see the most popular posts on Reddit.
>
> There is a **search feature** to find posts matching a given search term.
>
> Users can filter the data based on subreddits that are predifined in the sidebar.
> You can also **navigate to a subreddit** directly from a post, even if it's not appearing in the sidebar.
>
> When you scroll down, a button appears and allows you to **scroll back to the top**. It offers you an easier way to access again the sidebar or the search bar.
